Hi, thanks for the visit. my site is primarily a note taking ground, where its easier for me to remember i wrote a blog about something than how i did it!.

My posts are largely runbook / guides for how to do something, if you want to know more details (the whys of something works the way it does for example) i try and always add a reference section at the bottom of the post to get those kinds of details from someone wiser than myself :)
