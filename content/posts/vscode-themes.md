I normally just keep VSCode on the default dark theme and be done with it. But the vast number of `dev.to` and `medium` posts on it finally made me give it a try. Theres hundreds of posts out there on picking themes but below are some commands to help switch around and change things.

## Change theme

After installing your 100 different themes you will want to switch between them.

Manual: `File > Preferences > Color Theme`

Shortcut: `ctrl+k ctrl+t`

Either option, opens up the `Command palette` and lists out all themes you currently have installed ordered by theme type.

## Change icon theme

You can also change images if you wish and have installed those:

Manual: `File > Preferences > File Icon Theme`

## Change font

You can also change your font

Manual: `File > Preferences > Settings` then in settings `Text editor > Font > Font Family`
