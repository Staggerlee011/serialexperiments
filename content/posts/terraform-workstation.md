This is my current setup for kubernetes (running on WSL2 ubunutu-18)

## Install software

I currently use the following software to manage and interact with `Terraform`:

### tfenv

Terraform releases are quick and keeping all our environments on the same version isn't possible. `tfenv` resolves that by letting us have multiple versions installed and easy to manage.

### tfsec



## tflint
